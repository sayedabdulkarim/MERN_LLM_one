Steps to Train or Fine-Tune Your Local Model

1. Define Your Use Cases
   Identify the specific tasks for which you want to fine-tune the model. For example:
   Customer support queries (e.g., "Where is my order?")
   Personalized recommendations (e.g., "Suggest vegan restaurants.")
   Sentiment analysis (e.g., "The food was great, but delivery was late.")
   Generating SEO-friendly menu descriptions.
2. Collect and Prepare Training Data
   Customer Support Data: Collect historical customer queries and responses from your support system.
   Recommendation Data: Use user interaction data (e.g., viewed restaurants, ordered items, search queries).
   Sentiment Analysis Data: Gather customer reviews and label them with sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
   Menu Description Data: Use existing menu descriptions or create examples based on features/keywords.
   Example Format for Training Data:

For customer support:

{
"input": "Where is my order?",
"output": "You can track your order in the 'My Orders' section of the app."
}

For sentiment analysis:
{
"input": "The food was delicious, but the delivery was late.",
"output": {
"sentimentScore": 0.5,
"sentimentSummary": "Mixed sentiment. Positive feedback on food quality, but negative feedback on delivery time.",
"keyPoints": {
"positive": ["food was delicious"],
"negative": ["delivery was late"]
}
}
}

3. Set Up Your Local Environment
   Install the necessary tools for training the model locally:
   Hugging Face Transformers: For working with LLaMA models.
   PyTorch or TensorFlow: For model training.
   Datasets Library: For managing your training data.
   Example Installation:

4. Fine-Tune the Model
   Use the Hugging Face library to fine-tune the LLaMA model on your dataset.
   Example Code for Fine-Tuning:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the model and tokenizer

model_name = "llama3.2:1b"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load your dataset

dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "train_data.json", "test": "test_data.json"})

# Tokenize the dataset

def preprocess_function(examples):
return tokenizer(examples["input"], text_target=examples["output"], truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

# Define training arguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
output_dir="./results",
evaluation_strategy="epoch",
learning_rate=2e-5,
per_device_train_batch_size=8,
num_train_epochs=3,
save_steps=10_000,
save_total_limit=2,
)

# Initialize the Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
model=model,
args=training_args,
train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"],
)

# Train the model

trainer.train()

# Save the fine-tuned model

model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_llama")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_llama")
